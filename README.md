# Sliding Features
Modular sliding window with various signal processing functions and technical indicators including Normalization. Can be used for building low latency real-time trading systems. Values in window are updated at each time step. A View defines the function which processes the incoming values and provides and output value. Views can easily be added by implementing the View Trait which requires two functions:
- update(&mut self, val: f64)
- last(&self) -> f64

The Views can be parameterized as desired when created with new() function.
Add Views to SlidingWindow by calling register_view().
SlidingWindows last() function returns a vector of all the latest observations of all views that are currently registered. This vector can serve as input to a neural network or decision tree for creating trading agents.


### Views
A View defines the function which processes value updates. They currently include:
- Echo
- Normalizer
- Center of Gravity
- Cyber Cycle
- Laguerre RSI
- ReFlex
- TrendFlex
- ROC
- RSI

### How to use
See examples folder.
Run the examples using
```
cargo run --example simple
cargo run --example multiple
cargo run --example multiple_normalized
```
